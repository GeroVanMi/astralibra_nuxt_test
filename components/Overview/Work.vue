    <p class="indented text-white mt-3">
      I am a developer living in Winterthur, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. I like to loose
      myself in solving obscure problems. When I'm not doing that, then I'm
      likely trying to learn about something new.
    </p>
    <p class="indented text-white">
      In my free time I watch Anime, read and tend to plants. I am looking to
      write more, since it seems to be a good way of retaining information!
    </p>

      questions via
